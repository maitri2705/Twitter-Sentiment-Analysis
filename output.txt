Tweet Content: Trump's Opa (grandfather) was born "Friedrich Trumpf" (14.March 1869 ‚Äì 30.May 1918) &amp; Bavaria kicked him out forever because he evaded #military service.

Maybe Opa #Trump had a #HeelSpur
and besides, physical danger made him faint of heart.

Tweet Content: Hey @Lawrence, by saying the only possible reason for Manafort to cease cooperating is because of potential #Trump pardon you fall into the American naivety trap. Russians could have threatened his family. And we know they are keen on assassinations. #MSNBC #CNN #abc #CBSNews 
Sentiment: Negative 


Tweet Content: @MaddowBlog If #Trump thinks to pardon Manafort I suspect that there will be a whole suite of strategies in place to nail the president for #ObstructionOfJustice.

And I'd not be surprised if #RobertMueller has a sackful of state charges lined up for Manafort in case Trump pardons federally. 
Sentiment: Negative 


Tweet Content: @WalshFreedom Then you start a trade war with China? Impose steel tariffs on a number of countries? Now we will start to see the REAL Donald #Trump economy. One based on HIS decisions. He won't be able to cut corporate taxes again. Stocks are headed down and the fall will be painful. 
Sentiment: Negative 


Tweet Content: So here‚Äôs the pattern as I see it. #Trump makes a statement. The Press and the #Twitlibs go insane with the ‚ÄúRacist‚Äù, ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù and ‚ÄúIdiot‚Äù claims. A few days later it‚Äôs proven out that Trump was right. ‚ÄúBut we just don‚Äôt like the way he said it though.‚Äù Round and round we go.

Tweet Content: @robinlecronesco @TheTerribleHook @TorchSongBway @Mirvish @HillaryClinton @BillClinton Devolve to name calling and xenophobic remarks! Thats very characteristic of, mostly, #Trump supporters.
Observe, how I do not use those things for you. Politeness &amp; courtesy are #American values.
